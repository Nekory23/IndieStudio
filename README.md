The game you must implement is a Bomberman-like game.
Bomberman is one of the most famous video games of all time.
With over 70 franchises, ranging from the first version on MSX, ZX Spectrum and Sharp MZ-700 in 1983 to the lastest versions on modern consoles, over 10 million units have been sold.

Our gameplay reference is Neo Bomberman, released on the Neo Geo and MVS systems in 1997.

Here’s the required features :
- Local multi-player with the possibility to play with a friend + AI’s controlled bots.
- A main game menu (to start a new game or load an existing one).
- Your game must feature 3D graphics but a 2D gameplay.
- Your game must feature procedurally generated maps (random obstacles, random bonus...).
- Save/Load a game
- Animation and sounds to give life to the game (especially during various interactions)
  - Think about bomb explosion, player walking, background music, ...
    
- Some Power-ups
  - Bomb Up
  - Speed Up
  - Fire Up
  - Wall Pass
    
The goal of this project is not only to code a video game, but it’s to code a fully finished video game. This
means that the efforts you make to polish your game will count as much as the technical aspect.
Do your best to avoid clunky animations or graphical glitches, manage your camera in a way that the “out-side” of the game is never visible, pay attention to game design, level design and sound design, add variations in ennemies and environnements, etc.
